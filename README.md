# SC2002 Hospital Management System


HMS is an application aimed at automating the management of hospital operations,
including patient management, appointment scheduling, staff management, and billing.
The system is expected to facilitate efficient management of hospital resources, enhance
patient care, and streamline administrative processes.
## Deployment

The src folder contains all the implementation source for the HMS, within which are packages organising the files by their roles.

The res folder contains all the .csv files used as database. The application depends on these files to initialise correctly.
